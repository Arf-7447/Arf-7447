## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**Arf-7447/Arf-7447** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->
- âœ¨ You can call me Arif
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on myself, develop personal project
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning web development, backend, frontend, and other things
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on exciting web development projects
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with advanced JavaScript techniques and backend optimization
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Laravel, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, and Node.js
- âš¡ Fun fact: I once debugged a code for hours only to realize I missed a semicolon. Now, I always make sure my semicolons are well-fed and happy!
